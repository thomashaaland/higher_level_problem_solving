Timeit module
Slowest times:
Making array:  0.0139s
Snake loop:    2.7892s
Loop:          0.2577s

snake_loop is slowest with time:  2.7892s

Compared to manual timing we got a similar result.
The times for making the array is a bit less than in 
manual timing, but the Snake loop and loop are very similar.
This could indicate manual timing has a bit more overhead
compared to timeit, or it could be random. This is very hard
to say without more indepth statistics.
